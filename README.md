Wingsuit Line V.01
======================

This is a POC for leveraging Cesium to integrate into the larger project baseline.ws

Functionality:  
Leveraging GPS data from a flysight or similar gps unit, allow users to replay their wingsuit flight over Cesium earth.

Future Enhancements

* Leverage algorithms to determine transition from wingsuit flight to canopy flight.
    * Color Code wingsuit vs canopy
* Leverage algorithm to cut out ‘noise’ (time spent before existing and time spent on ground before unit is turned off.
* Parse data from pre-existing uploaded data sets
* Overlay critical data in real time
    * Horizontal Speed
    * Vertical Decent Rate
    * Glide Ratio
